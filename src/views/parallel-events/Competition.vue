        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The APPT-2025 invites participation in the CCF TCARCH Student Research Challenge (SRC). The SRC is a forum for undergraduates and graduate students to share their research results, exchange ideas, and improve their communication skills while competing for prizes.</p>

        <h2>Awards</h2>
        <p>The top 3 undergraduate and graduate winners will be recognized in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We will present elegant award plaques, and monetary prizes will also be granted.</li>
          <li>The names of the winners will be posted on the website.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>We target free researchers from the shackles of realism, removes the blinders of short-term thinking, and opens the scientific mind to uncharted frontiers. Falls within the APPT purview and is related to computer architecture, software computing, cloud computing, parallel algorithms and emerging applications in some capacity. Interdisciplinary ideas that touch on multiple topics are preferred, but not required. The judges will also evaluate the work based on factors such as rationality, originality, and thought-provoking quality.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Presentation Format</h2>
        <p>The SRC consists of a presentation session. Submissions recommended for acceptance by the selection committee will be invited to a SRC presentation session at APPT and compete for the top places. The evaluation will be concentrated on the quality of both visual and oral presentation, the research methods, and the significance of contribution.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>A participant and submission in the SRC must meet all the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The participant must submit an abstract PDF anonymously of up to 800 words (not including references) outlining the content of a presentation that is going to be presented during the challenge competition. Table and graphs are welcomed to support the idea.</li>
          <li>The abstract may be authored by more than one student. However, only the lead student (first author) is considered as a participant in the SRC and must satisfy the eligibility criteria described here.</li>
          <li>Undergraduate students may present team projects. If a graduate student is part of a group research project, they may only present their part of the research.</li>
          <li>The submission entry should describe the research problem, motivation and background, techniques and results.</li>
          <li>It should state the novelty and contributions of the work explicitly.</li>
          <li>The abstract must have not appeared before. Novelty is one of the criteria for selection.</li>
          <li>The abstract must be authored by the participant.</li>
          <li>The participant can be from anywhere in the world but must maintain an undergraduate or graduate student status as of the submission deadline.</li>
          <li>SRC allows parallel submissions of full papers in other conferences, as long as they abide by self-plagiarism rules (e.g., at least 30% of both the SRC abstract and the other publication is unique). That is, any paper needs to be a minimum of 30% different than a prior paper. Thus a full-length version of a paper would have to be at least 30% different than a SRC submission. Again, self-plagiarism rules would still be in effect. For each accepted SRC abstract, the abstract will be posted on the APPT website. The content, however, can be included in a future submission to other conferences or journals.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
